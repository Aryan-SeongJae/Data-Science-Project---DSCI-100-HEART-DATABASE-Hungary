    "The term heart (cardiovascular) disease describes a range of heart conditions that arise from problems with the heart and blood vessels. One of these is coronary artery disease, which is when the arteries supplying blood to the heart narrow. Many risk factors can increase the chance of developing this disease, including cholesterol levels and maximum heart rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "High levels of cholesterol result in fatty deposits in blood vessels that clog them, making it difficult for enough blood to flow through the arteries. When these deposits break suddenly, they form a clot resulting in a heart attack or stroke. If a patient has heart disease, their maximum heart rate could significantly decrease (WebMD, 2002).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our question is: Is a new patient likely to have heart disease, based on serum cholesterol and maximum heart rate achieved? To answer this, we will use a knn classifier algorithm."
